# Gif Search Engine

Please implement a simple gif search engine using the Giphy API.

Use jQuery for this.

## Phase 1: UI Implementation

Create, using javascript, functionality that will `console.log` out the value user has typed into the input field

- this `console.log` should be observed when:
 - the user hits the **submit** button *and* 
 - when the user hits the **enter** key in the input field

 ## Phase 2: Dynamic Data

 Go to **[this page](https://developers.giphy.com/)** and determine which endpoint you must hit to pull in the gif search results of a "query". 

 - how does this relate to your UI implemented above?

 ## Phase 3: Display results

 - Initially, display ONE result
 - Eventually, display multiple results
